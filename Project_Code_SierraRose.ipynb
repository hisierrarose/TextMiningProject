For such a vulgar sex act, why doesn’t the book talk about the leather/kink community which is a vastly important part of the queer community??

When I finished I couldn't figure out why it was banned, so I did so research and the scene that got it banned didn't even register with me.  I didn't even remember it was in the book.  I was a HS librarian so I'm pretty sensitive to what might make people freak out, but I honestly didn't get it.  I think the problem with this book was it's exploration of working class Mexican Americans and the rich people in their community.  I found the book very entertaining, and I know nothing about lawn care/landscaping so that was interesting too.\n",

Both books are coming of age stories with some gay characters, bullying and hypocritical adults in them. Middle and high schoolers know this stuff already. Flamer won awards and is very well-designed. Blankets is more all over the place and autobiographical. The town revolted against the conservatives and they quit the school board.

I enjoy reading graphic novels and I have an art background but this is not the typical subject matter I choose.

      "The Kama sutra: genuinely extremely helpful. For a fourteen year old boy in Mississippi who got most of his knowledge about sex from porn, this book was far and away the healthiest depiction of intimacy and sexual relationships I’d seen in my life, and included a lot of very helpful information.

I generally hold that kids will get out of adult content only what they already understand (at least on a mechanical level; not so much ideas), but graphic novels aren't constrained in that way.

When my parents found out, they regretted not being there to help and mentor their older teen child with bullying and severe depression from a story that's old enough to be my uncle; and from a guy that wouldn't fully understand how literature can change our mental health and beliefs until the parents and students complained. Banned books have made me even more intelligent than ever; but for students under 18- having a teacher or a trustworthy adult helping you with triggering content that you connect with, can protect your mental health from having severe consequences.

But I can remember a banned comic in the 90s that I didn't like at all named Boiled Angel. An artist named Mike Diana was prosecuted, and convicted and barred from writing or drawing and subject to random search to verify he was in compliance. And 3 years in jail. It's insane that happened in America, in my lifetime, but it did. The comic itself, not my thing, didn't care for the art and the subject matter was pretty cringe. But the state of Florida went straight 1984 on him.\n",

That struck me as odd, and I often wondered why people were so mysterious or obnoxious when they talked about this subject. But because I couldn't change things, I said as little as possible or asked my girlfriends for information. After I'd learned quite a lot, Mother once said to me, \"Anne, let me give you some good advice. Never discuss this with boys, and if they bring it up, don't answer them.\n",

Challenging a book or moving it from one section of a library to another or even putting an age rating like they do films is considered a ban by some groups. That is not to justify actual book bans nor is it to discredit legitimate concerns over certain works, but IMO here in the US the phrase 'banned book' is losing it's meaning.\n",

We all had to get permission slips signed, and we got to pick a book off of the banned book list. Mine was \"Go Ask Alice.\" I remember the book, but even more,  I remember how it made me feel. Most of my classmates were reacting as you would imagine a bunch of 12-13 year old kids would, but I took I seriously.  I felt like I was being entrusted with something precious. I'd read books with adult themes and steamy scenes, drugs and violence. I'd been raiding my dad's steven King books since I was eight or so. But our teachers made it a point to say \"These books are banned, because some adults don't think you can handle them. I think you can be mature enough to look past the parts that make us giggle, and see the story as a whole\" (paraphrasing, but that's the gist) and I took that responsibility seriously. I wanted to be seen as mature and older. It made me feel good to be seen as a person, not just as a \"kid\". I took it seriously.\n",

      "Breathtaking understatement aside, I've often found that works originally written in German have a strange kind of *rigidity* to the prose.  I can't really explain it beyond saying that they never seem to achieve anything resembling a smooth flow.  If the best books in english are water flowing down a smooth hill, those written in German are more a beautiful staircase.  (I do not know what the cause is either.  Is it the translation itself, or that the German language encourages such rigidity?  Is it a style choice or other similar convention that is simply not popular in the books I read?)\n",

At the time I was young and ignorant and had been told my whole life that socialism was a pack of lies and the most evil force on earth.

      "\n",
      "Honestly, when I finally got around to reading the Manifesto, I was struck by how easily digestible it was...but also how very obviously a product of its time and obsolete it was. Marx's approach to history is very clearly attempting to do for it what Newton did for physics--come up with a predictive theory for what happens next, having seen the French Revolution and how it changed Europe. In that, the theory of class struggle and the prediction of the polarization of society into the bourgeois and proletariat is an interesting model. \n",

      "And The Band Played On by Randy Shilts: AIDS is gay history, present, and future. Shilts lived in the 80s and witnessed how AIDS effected the gay community first hand eventually dying from the disease itself. It is a wildly important book for gay history and sincerely puts things in perspective. That being said, many have criticized his coinage of “patient o.” In the book he credits one man to spreading the virus horrendously; modern science says he could have not have started it. Still a very good read!\n",

      "Freddie Mercury: Somebody to Love: I absolutely loved this book and I didn’t know much about Queen. It begins with how HIV started in 1908 in Africa and continues to look at Freddie’s life; as he becomes a superstar, the virus quickly spreads alongside his fame. It’s a beautiful book. If you’ve seen Bohemian Rhapsody, this book will open your eyes: he was not as innocent as the movie shows! (He literally wore a shirt for a gay sex club in one of his music videos (The Mineshaft!))\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlimited Intimacy by Tim Dean: This one is controversial, but I love it. Looking at hardcore gay pornography of the late 90s, early 2000s, Dr. Dean analyzes how gay men have sex. Once men began to realize HIV/AIDS was no longer a serious threat, that due to medicine men no longer dropped like flies, gay men started to have unprotected sex. The book, to me, is wildly important because it discusses things other scholars would greatly ignore. Since this book’s release, PrEP has been approved and now barebacking is extremely common with gay men. That being said, I loved this book because it was insight in how a stigmatized community could find love and desire with each other.\n",

Again, I compare it to the communist manifesto, also written in German, that I think does a good job of fitting that staircase description while still being understandable and well written. Hitler is just all over the goddamn place, part of which is that he very badly wanted to be an artistic person but had no artistic capacity, part of it is that the fascist worldview is rotten with contradiction and sporadic, knee jerk bigotries. Like the Turner diaries: a ‘heroic’ tale of overthrowing a violent, tyrannical government through the use of race massacres and nuclear holocaust to establish a violent, tyrannical dictatorship.

Main Kampf on the other hand is primarily going to be translated by people wanting to convey the propaganda but not make the message sound appealing.

      "books are banned in public school libraries, as determined by the administrators of the individual school districts. In most school districts there aren't separate libraries for different students; everyone uses the same library. In some school districts there isn't a special school library at all and everyone uses the public library which gains some extra funding from the school district in compensation. In some districts there's a single library building that everyone in the district uses, and in some districts there is a separate library building for each school in the district, with the libraries sharing books around as people request them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a book is banned from a district library it isn't allowed in the entire system - if a kindergartener can't access it then a senior can't either, and vice versa. Thus a book being banned means that no one can check it out at all; some districts restrict books, but that simply limits the book's ability to be shared and loaned, nothing is stopping a kindergartener from walking into the high school's library, pulling a restricted book off the shelf, and reading it while still inside the library - they just may not be allowed to check out the book.\n",

Though just a midshipman at the time - and a fairly incompetent one - he almost caused the state of Georgia to secede 35 years prior to the Civil War.

Of course it was banned back in 2005, so I made a point of buying all banned books from that point so that my son could grow up reading books that were meant to be read.  I may pick up this one as well, even though he is 21 ;)\n",

Some of us were also some of the only non-white students in the school and we were already treated with some suspicion. \n",

      "The ban applies to all school districts in the state of Utah. None of these titles would ever be found in anything other than a high school library or high school English classroom library, so banning them for elementary and middle schools is pointless theatre. The ultimate decision makers for what students should be allowed to read are their parents, not lawmakers or politicians or school board members. If a parent doesn't want their student reading \"What Girls Are Made Of\", that's their choice. However, they don't get to make that choice for other people's children. School libraries curate their collections very carefully for elementary school, a bit less so for middle school. But by the time high school rolls around, most of these students will have seen and read so much on the internet that these books won't be the gateway to corruption many adults seem to think they are, and so library collections are much more inclusive of adult titles. Motivating modern kids to read books when faced with the easy addictive scrolling of social media means showing them reality, however grim and NSFW that might seem. Therefore, if you don't want your student reading certain types of material, then YOU, as a parent, need to read what your child is reading and make a decision for YOUR own child alone, not anyone else's. What might be one person's ~~pornography~~ erotica or immorality might be another's life-changing read.\n",

And like 1/3 of the class showed up b/c it was a nerd class and we talked about the books. To this day I can't figure out why the Plague was banned. The Wife's Tale had a little bit of hanky panky but it read to me like an elaborate fart joke. That's when I realized the people who ban books don't read books and are idiots.

The basic gist of it is that local school boards have broad discretion to manage the materials and curriculum in the school with certain restrictions. The tricky part is that these restrictions are a bit nebulous, and in this particular case I'm not sure how the courts would rule because the wording hinges on 3 or more school boards triggering a statewide ban. I would imagine the individual boards banning would be upheld by the courts, but I don't know what they would say about some board enacting a statewide policy. \n",

The second book is really where it picks up in terms of plot IMO. Overall I’d recommend it!\n",

I, myself, fell in love with some guy Terry's books. Great author. But if Terry told me I needed a sex change or that I needed to buy into crypto to support the patriarchy, then I would step away.

      "_Banning_ is using the power of the law to restrict the availability of books. That shouldn't happen, IMO -- the State, no matter how democratic, is not a trustworthy arbiter of what materials are acceptable.\n",

      "Library _curation_, however, is an important and valuable tool. A librarian for a grade school, for example, should be choosing materials that support the mission of the school and are appropriate (in both level and content) for grade-school kids. A librarian for a grade school that was including books with actually explicit sex scenes is not doing a very good job; but the same librarian might reasonably include a book that discusses the existence of incest in an age-appropriate way. And that might even include a fictional story where it's clear that characters are in an incestuous relationship (like a story which mentions a person being pregnant with their Uncle's child or the like).\n",

      "Parents challenging a school library's inclusion of material as not age-appropriate is a reasonable and important capability to offer; and that's true even though many pearl-clutching parents would like to abuse that process to \"protect\" their kids from having access to material they merely disagree with.\n",

      "When you combine abuse of process with laws that make the process easier to abuse, and you turn loose a subculture that thinks the mere mention of something like homosexuality or trans people is automatically \"sexually explicit\", you get problems. Those problems are amplified dramatically when the same subculture doesn't understand that sex and sexual content -- in both fiction and non-fiction contexts -- are actually age-appropriate (though of course there is some room to discuss exactly how explicit such materials can be before they're _not_ appropriate) much earlier than their personal morality suggests.\n",

Abridging these are all things the Protestant kings did to Catholics and the Catholic kings did right back (and both sides did to the smaller Christian sects--there's a reason the Puritans went to the Netherlands for awhile).

When the Egyptians slaughter the Hebrew children due to an Egyptian prophecy that the Hebrews would destroy the kingdom, God saves the prophesied child and sends him to be adopted by the royal family. Drawn from the river is Moses. Once Moses learns he is Hebrew and kills a slave master, he flees Egypt for Semitic lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Moses doesn't stay there. God taps Moses, and sends him back to Egypt to be his prophet carrying a great staff. God knows that Moses' adoptive brother that now rules as Pharaoh will exonerate him of any wrongdoing. Which the Pharaoh does, forgiving past *and future* crimes. Moses asks for the Hebrews to be freed and is laughed at, but the laughing stops when the plagues begin. The Nile is turned against the Egyptians, their crops fail, and their livestock perish. Soon, Pharaoh is ready to let the Hebrews go; so severe is the power of God and so great the suffering of Egypt. What happens then?\n",

      "Isn't that weird? The Hebrews had won. They were to be freed. But God doesn't take the W. Instead, Pharaoh and Egypt are made to endure more and worse plagues. Things like fire raining from the sky and unending darkness. So Pharaoh turns to what had worked on the Hebrews before, a culling. Which God turns back upon the Egyptians with Passover and the Angel of Death. Finally, Pharaoh releases the Hebrews, and they make their way out of Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then God hardens Pharaoh's heart *again*. Pharaoh sends an *army* after the Hebrews to destroy them. God protects the Hebrews with a pillar of fire, and opens a passageway across the sea to the Semitic lands. And when Pharaoh's heart is hardened again, he sends his army the same route, where God consumes them. Pharaoh is left alone and Egypt is destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what's going on here? A lot of interpretations that presume a benevolent Christian God say that it's really Pharaoh making his choices, but that's not really how the story is written. Elsewhere in the story when it says God does something, God is doing something. So why would God do that? The key is to think of God as a character that *isn't* omnipotent or benevolent. Think of His motivations and feelings.\n",
      "\n",

      "God's punishment for Pharaoh is to make Pharaoh *endure all the pain and loss that a god does*. God's punishment is not just for the harm he has done to the Hebrews.

You shall know My pain.\" Pharaoh shall hear his people cry for salvation, and see his own beloved children die. For *that* is what it means to be a god. So when He sends Moses, God hardens Pharaoh's heart because *God's vengeance is not yet satisfied*.\n",

I think on another level, we are supposed to understand that their time in Sodom and Gomorrah DID corrupt Lot, wife, and daughters. He is anything but a righteous man. By offering his daughters he is making the best of a bad situation, but he is still doing something bad. There is often ironic reversal through narrative patterns throughout the Bible. He offers his daughters to the population against their will and is willing to dishonor them, and later on they use him against his will by getting him drunk and dishonor him in the false belief that they are honoring and continuing his line. Biblical stories are full of these sorts of ironic reversals like that usually based on the behaviors of the characters.\n",

      "Just because I find it interesting and not well known, praying to the saints in Catholicism has more to do with how their dogma views \"the nature of sin\". A lot of Protestant faiths look at sin as a failure of the sinner, Catholic dogma preaches that sinfulness is caused by a disruption in your connection to God. Since your connection to God has been disrupted, rather than asking God for help, you ask it's emissaries how to go about repairing that connection. Confession is believed to be of similar purpose, but asking a human emissary rather than a heavenly one. Im not a believer myself for a number of reasons but I grew up Catholic and find faith and religious/spiritual beliefs kinda fascinating.\n",

Some ideas are so entrenched so as to not need defending because they are assumed true de facto while contrasting opinions require mountains of articulate evidence to argue a counternarrative.

I've literally never heard of a cishet person who actually turned out to be cishet having that kind of experience. Also, kids have no trouble empathizing with all kinds of characters, regardless of whether or not that character is like them. I remember when I was growing up, my parents bought us American Girl dolls, and me and my sister both picked our favorites, and my sister picked the black one and my parents went through this whole like, does she hate her race/skin color thing, but no, she actually just liked the black girl's story the best.

Their attempts to diminish other people's lives so that they're as small as their owns is a disgusting level of selfishness. We all read a ton of stuff every day and we almost never accept any of it. We're bombarded with millions of ads everyday, using the latest and best research and it has almost zero impact. Reading one book is probably not going to have any impact on you. Reading will, b/c of how it changes your ability to process information. These are people incapable of critical thinking and terrified that children will develop these skills. They won't be converted to being gay/trans/anti-white racists, but they will be able to critically assess the world and realize there's nothing wrong with being gay/trans/not white. That attempt to stunt children's minds is enraging to me.\n",

No one is disputing that there is a lot of literature with content that is not appropriate for children and teens, and therefore not admissible to public school libraries. The problem is those that are choosing what content is acceptable or not for children. Sherman Alexie’s *The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,* which chronicles a child of Native American decent struggling with growing up in poverty on a reservation, is considered “not appropriate,” for teens because it mentions taboo topics such as racism and going through puberty and exploring masturbation. Crap teens already know more than enough about anyway. Or a book like *Boy Meets Boy,* or *Heartstopper,* which are completely benign books that help questioning teens understand that they’re not so different and shouldn’t feel alienated because they feel a certain way. Books that also tactfully tackle topics such as prejudice, homophobia, sexual assault, eating disorders. All real life problems that kids absolutely face every day. And those kids deserve access to those helpful books, despite anything their parents believe, because lots of children are raised in abusive, unsupportive, and unstable homes.\n",

Children should have access to literature that interests them and supports their reading level. I had a college grade reading level in middle school and read books that wouldn't be considered appropriate, but it didn't change me. Just made me want to read more, learn more about other people and places and views. Also, as hard as we may try to sanitize schools and whatnot, we also have the internet to contend with.

      "Comment by mgiltz: In Florida alone, more than 10,000 titles have been pulled from shelves and can't be accessed by anyone. Books have faced bans and removals and being made inaccessible all over the country for decades. Exactly zero bans have been placed on The Turner Diaries. I'm not sure what constitutes KKK propaganda in your mind–new member handouts? But I would expect a good library to offer access to material like The Turner Diaries and the Protocols of Zion and the KKK. Exactly none of that is held at public school libraries for kids. Many libraries have copies of Birth of a Nation, the silent movie that is wildly racist and  shows the KKK as heroes. It was at one point the most popular film in US history...until it was beaten out by Gone With The Wind. (Read the novel and you'll discover Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes were taking part in some lovely KKK-style terrorizing of people the night they went out and got injured and had to pretend to be drunk when those darn Yankees checked up on them to see if they'd taken part). And all those libraries have copies of the novel Gone With The Wind. Libraries are not meant to be places where only the books I approve of can be found. Or only the books you approve of. How about you pay attention to what your kids read and let other parents do the same? And talk to your local librarian. They're not some monster trying to force filth on your child. They are professionals who love their job, when it doesn't involve attacks and being threatened by jail time for doing it.\n",

They also don't offer heroin or a thousand other harmful things. So banning books you don't like is bad. Pretending it's the only way to stop something that never has and never will happen is absurd. You should go talk to your local librarian. They're great professionals with better degrees than I ever obtained and love finding the right books for every kid and helping them do research and finish their homework and learn about all the great stuff a library can offer. I'm sure they will address any concerns you might have.\n",

Therefore, it makes sense that it would be appropriate for kids of her age to read about it. \n",

Yes, the edited version of her diary is usually assigned in schools, because that was the initial version to be published, and because it is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter. However, I’m not sure how you’re failing to grasp that just because the edited version is typically assigned in schools, that doesn’t mean the unedited version is banned or censored in those schools. There would be no consequence, in places without book bans, for stocking the unedited version in the library or bringing it into a classroom. Also, I find your obsessive focus on the masturbation sequences of the diary to be, frankly, weird as hell. These represent a couple brief passages in the diary, out of hundreds and hundreds of pages. Anne Frank was not writing porn, she was writing about her lived experience as a teenage girl, and I think it’s extremely important for young people to learn and read about sex and sexuality, just as important as it is to learn about war and genocide.\n",

If we’re not going to put every book up for a vote of approval to the electorate, I’d rather leave it to the librarians, who typically take into consideration such factors as what books teachers, parents, and students are requesting be included in the library, what’s being checked out more than others, what might be of interest and appropriate for the student body, and other similar considerations when curating a particular library.\n",

      "\n",
      "> SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WGEM) - The Illinois House passed a bill Wednesday that would prohibit libraries from banning books or other material because of partisan or doctrinal pressure, prompting strong opposition from Republicans who called it an assault on local control.\n",
      "\n",
      "> House Bill 2789 is an initiative of Democratic Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, whose office oversees the Illinois State Library and administers several grant programs for public and school libraries as well as adult literacy programs throughout the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "> The bill would require that as a condition of qualifying for those grants in the future, libraries or library systems would have to adopt a written policy prohibiting the practice of banning books. Alternatively, they could adopt the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights, which includes a statement that “(m)aterials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> The bill came in response to a wave of high-profile controversies throughout the country, including at least one in Illinois. School districts and public libraries have come under pressure to remove certain material from their collections, often material dealing with issues involving race, sexuality and gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Banning books is the sort of behavior that was once, for good reason, associated with the worst, most repressive and repugnant authoritarian regimes of the mid-20th century and before,” the bill’s lead sponsor Rep. Anne Stava-Murray, D-Naperville, said during debate on the House floor. “The fact that this is even up for discussion in America in the 21st century is disgusting. And yet, just last year in my district, that discussion was spurred on by a few radical parents and the Proud Boys hate group over a book called ‘Gender Queer.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "> That book is a memoir by Maia Kobabe about a nonbinary person grappling with issues of gender identity and sexuality as a teenager and young adult. According to the New York Times, it has been pulled from library shelves in dozens of school districts around the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "> One of the school districts that came under pressure to remove the book was Community High School District 99, in Downers Grove, in Stava-Murray’s district. According to a June 2022 Chicago Sun-Times story, the pressure was generated by a group of conservative parents and members of the Proud Boys, but students in the district pushed back and the board eventually voted unanimously to keep the book on the shelves.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Students led a community-supported effort in my district to keep the book in the library,” Stava-Murray said. “But kids shouldn’t have to be the heroes… Nobody is forcing you or your children to check out or purchase or read these books. If they are not consistent with your personal beliefs, don’t read them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> PEN American, in a report on book bans around the country, identified five enforced bans in the state between July 2021 and June 2022, including 3 bans of Gender Queer.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Some Republicans, however, argued that public libraries are governed by locally elected boards, and that those boards should have the authority to decide how best to serve their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “I find this a complete assault on local control,” said Rep. Martin McLaughlin, R-Barrington Hills. “… These people volunteer as nonpartisan elected local officials, and for the state to tell a local library board, ‘listen to the professionals; follow the professionals’ – I don’t understand why we have local elections anymore if a bill like this passes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville, said that he used to serve on his local library board and when his own children visit the library, they are accompanied by a parent. But he said that is not necessarily the case when they are at school using the school library.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “I am not for banning books at all,” he said. “I am for age-appropriate materials. And so, if a parent wants their kid to have those age-appropriate materials, they can certainly get them for them. I don’t think that a librarian is the end-all, be-all decision maker in the state of Illinois on what books should be given to a child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Stava-Murray, however, rejected those arguments, saying the bill would only add another condition onto the rules to qualify for grants administered by the secretary of state. Last year, the office awarded more than 1,600 grants totaling more than $62 million, including a $4,300 grant to Downers Grove Community High School District 99.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “In terms of the argument about local control, I find that disgusting. Local Control has long been a dog whistle for allowing statewide or nationwide racist or bigoted policies to persist,” she said, eliciting loud boos from the Republican side of the aisle. “Today, I just strongly urge my colleagues to do the right thing and make sure that access to books is not infringed upon in our state.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> The bill passed the House 69-39 with all of the no votes coming from Republicans. Three Democrats and one Republican were recorded as present but not voting. The bill next goes to the Senate for consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Public and school libraries are facing unprecedented censorship of books and resources, not just in Illinois but throughout the nation,” Giannoulias said in a statement after the vote. “This important first-in-the-nation legislation combats book banning and upholds freedom of speech, which America has always stood for. I applaud the Illinois House of Representatives for passing this important measure and encourage the State Senate to do the same.”\n",

      "Comment by TheBigPhilbowski: \"You see,\" my colleague went on, \"one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n",

A teacher/school/school board may opt not to teach a book, or keep it in a school library, and that is not considered a First Amendment violation. However, actually removing a book from library shelves based on content COULD be unconstitutional. So might confiscating a book from a student be. In US public schools, the First Amendment is weaker than it is in the general public, under the reasoning that there is a certain interest in maintaining order and appropriateness in the school setting. There is also a different standard in public schools and private schools.\n",

This becomes an issue when the state government decides that books which deal with subjects like slavery, segregation, feminism, the industrial revolution, and other such historically significant topics are \"inappropriate\" for children and then subsequently forbid said literature, or maybe even worse, decide to *alter* history books to remove said information.\n",

There absolutely are books that shouldn't be in school libraries, but no school librarians were stocking them in the first place. Instead, politicians were using this power to censor ideas that kids should be able to learn about. Ideas like \"LGBTQ+ people are normal members of society\".\n",

      "Comment by Lopeyface: A lot of factors matter. Say you have a book about being trans. These are often targets of so-called \"bans.\" If a school doesn't have that book in its library, and decides not to buy it for the library, that's probably not a First Amendment violation. That library also doesn't have lots of other books. But I can imagine scenarios where that could change. Maybe the book is part of a standard library catalog that other schools in the district purchase ordinarily to keep their catalogs current, and this particular school specifically excludes this particular book from its order after the principal says publicly that \"we don't want that satanic garbage in our school.\" Well, maybe we have an issue now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say the same book is already on the library shelves, and the school decides to remove it. That could be fine (maybe the book contains depictions of graphic sex not appropriate for school children, and should never have been there) or it could be a constitutional problem (maybe the book is entirely appropriate and the school is motivated only by bigotry against the trans community).\n",
      "\n",
      "Say the book isn't in the library at all, but a student brings it to school and an administrator confiscates it. That could be a problem--or not, again, depending on content. It's fine for an administrator to confiscate a pornographic magazine. Probably everyone agrees with that. Some books certainly are sufficiently \"vulgar\" to be removed. At what point does honest discussion of sexual development, love, gender identity, puberty, etc., cross a line? Most people probably have slightly different answers based on their own experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, of course, keep in mind that the setting matters also. Any book might be confiscated if a student is reading it during class, even if it is content neutral. By the same token, teachers can punish students for talking during class. That's not a First Amendment violation; it's necessary to the functioning of the school.\n",
      "\n",

My friends across the country talk about k-12 being one school or K-8 and then 9-12. So Having arbitrary restrictions on school libraries like 5th grades shouldn't be reading books, what happens when the 5th grader and the 12th grader share the same library? Sure you can police what books they check out, but the administrative costs to properly dividing the two don't outweigh the \"risk\" of a 5th grader reading out of his age range. Especially when there is nothing preventing that 5th grader from just going home and looking it up or worse. And as someone who grew up during the pre-protect the kids on the internet era, I would *Much* rather have kids have a more controlled space like a school library too look into these sensitive topics where there *should* be informed adults who can answer their questions.

By an absurd amount of criteria and metrics because the history of any empire, especially the American empire, is rife with examples of how the \"free market\" is a detrimental oxymoron. We are not starting at a neutral position for any given topic; laws have already shaped who gets to share which ideas by which platform and with what sort of funding. Even for what cost. Some ideas are so entrenched so as to not need defending because they are assumed true de facto while contrasting opinions require mountains of articulate evidence to argue a counternarrative. In many cases, no one has the time or inclination to give the spectrum of competing ideas a reasonable consideration so they resort to aggregators (by what criteria) and authorities (who?). \n",

It's a carefully constructed system of ideas that are intended to influence people. You can see Anita Bryant parroting the exact same rhetoric we still see today, all the way back in the 70s.

His writing style can be a bit clunky at times, and the plots, while exciting, can be a little far-fetched.  It's similar to The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in a way.  If you're new to that type of story, it can feel profound.  But if you're already well-read, you might find it a bit simplistic.

      "\n",
      "> In the sacred halls of the ancient library, where the light of knowledge danced upon the walls like the shadows of Da Vinci's secret codes, Robert Langdon found himself before an enigma that would challenge even the most brilliant minds of modern times. The mystery: multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Langdon's expert fingers traced the symbols on the parchment. Before him lay not the Fibonacci Sequence, but something more primal, more universal. It was the very essence of growth, of expansion, of the universe's own heartbeat—multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Multiplication,\" he whispered, his voice barely a breath over the silent reverence of the library, \"is not merely a mathematical operation; it's a symphony of numbers, a dance of digits where each participant holds the key to the next level of understanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> He imagined the numbers as ancient symbols, each with its own history, its own story. Consider, for instance, the humble number three. Alone, it was a mere whisper in the vastness of numerical eternity. But when paired with another number, say five, through the arcane ritual of multiplication, a transformation occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Three times five,\" Langdon murmured, his mind conjuring images of three groups, each holding five golden apples from Newton's orchard. \"Fifteen,\" he concluded, the answer emerging like a revelation from the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "> But multiplication, he knew, was more than just the accumulation of apples or the multiplication of light through prisms. It was a code, a pattern that repeated itself in the spirals of galaxies, in the growth rings of trees, in the very structure of DNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Every multiplication,\" Langdon explained to an unseen audience, \"is a gateway to understanding the universe's scale. When you multiply, you are not just calculating; you are scaling the heights of knowledge, from the microcosms to the macrocosms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> He envisioned a scenario where numbers were characters in a grand narrative. Two, multiplied by itself, became four, an echo of the dual nature of light as both particle and wave. Eight times nine, a cryptic passage leading to seventy-two, the number of names of God in some mystical traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Yet, there is danger here,\" Langdon warned, his eyes narrowing. \"Like the Illuminati's hidden knowledge, the power of multiplication can be misused. It can inflate the small to the overwhelming, or diminish the vast to the mundane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> He paused, letting the gravity of his words settle like dust in the ancient library. \"But when used with wisdom,\" he continued, \"multiplication is the art of creation, the architect's tool for designing the future, the mathematician's key to unlocking the secrets of the cosmos.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> With that, Langdon turned away from the parchment, his quest for understanding not ended but merely paused. Multiplication, like all great mysteries, was not just to be solved but to be lived, experienced, and marveled at in every moment of existence.\n",

Angels and Demons was good but didn’t quite inspire the same intensity, and by the third book, I figured out the bad guy in less than 20 pages. His formula was too obvious, though I felt like the Washington DC one was slightly better? But maybe that’s because I had over a decade to forget the formula.\n",

      "A lot of the controversy, I believe, came from the way his first real hit, *The Da Vinci Code*, was presented. Before the opening of the story, there is the \"facts\" page claiming that the Priory of Sion was real and descriptions of art, architecture, secret rituals, etc... are historically accurate. I think now it is acknowledged as part of the fictional work, but is not clearly indicated as such. And while promoting the book, Brown claimed that this history presented is entirely accurate (far from it). Obviously, historians and people who care about history do not like fictional history presented as real history, even as background for a fictional story. If he hadn't kept insisting that his made-up background to the story was actual real history, I don't expect there would have been so much backlash.\n",

My main issue with SG is that it has poor organization mechanisms built in. GR has the shelves feature that allow me to have shelves for a bunch of different things, whether it's moods or when I'm planning on reading a book or whatever. SG basically just has \"To-Read\" and that's it. You can apply filters to that list, but that's not enough in my opinion. If SG implemented that I'd leave GR altogether, but that's too basic and important a feature to be missing.\n",

In goodreads, it feels like a lot of reviews are written for engagement (since you can like and comment on reviews) and just feel a lot more... social? I prefer storygraph since the reviews are just there and you can't really do anything with them except for read them. Also the .25, .5 and .75 star ratings definitely help.

The app is still barely usable especially for a website that has cornered the public book review market for so long. And that's just the superficial issues and not getting into the human issues of review combing, doxxing and attacking people for leaving \"negative\" reviews etc that seems to happen on a weekly basis. Amazon have basically treated like the Wild West because unfortunately the ad space is worth it as long as people still frequent Goodreads.\n",

If teachers did that the classroom would turn into absolute bedlam. Politicians do it because being vulgar isn't a good bet unless you already know your audience well. Trump tries to speak in an authoritative style of language and consistently fails because he can't distinguish between excitement and disgust and has issues with boundaries. He's a sex predator and desecration excites him. \n",

      "The US’ unconditional support for Israel and refusal to stop any weapons shipments despite the documented war crimes has made the US *deeply* unpopular in the past year. Biden cannot get anyone to take him seriously on Iran when he does the literal same things he blames them for (he complained that Iran is giving weapons to Russia and therefore they are complicit in every civilian death in Ukraine, but seems incapable of seeing the irony). Biden wants international sanctions on Russia for invading a country and killing massive amounts of civilians, but gives Israel a complete pass. He’s undermining the international system that the US championed. \n",

      "The vast majority of the US public in both parties wants aid to Israel to be conditioned and for Biden to press both sides to a ceasefire. Biden doesn’t need to pass any new laws; he just has to follow the existing Lehy Law that says aid must be suspended if the recipient is committing war crimes. Another federal law says   Aid can’t be given to any country that blocks US humanitarian aid from being delivered and Israel is in violation of both. Biden is openly ignoring these laws and they are making him politically unpopular by doing so. It would strengthen the US’ standing among our allies in the Middle East AND Europe, as well as with multiple factions inside Israel who are angry that Netanyahu doesn’t care about the hostages and is turning down deals to return them all home.\n",

It is also a fact that more people in florida went to the polls with the intent to vote for Gore (see the butterfly ballot on Wikipedia for those who don’t know). But, under the rules, Bush won Florida but within the margin for a mandatory recount. After the mandatory recount (which turns out was just running ballots through the machines again), Gore was still behind, but within the margin where he could ask for a hand recount (see hanging chad on Wikipedia for an explanation on why this could change the outcome).  In what in hindsight was a major tactical error by his campaign, Gore requested recounts in Democratic counties. He was picking up votes and was within 500 votes of taking the lead when the Supreme Court, in a decision many legal scholars considered up there with Dred Scott on the list of bad Supreme Court decisions, stopped the counting and installed Bush. Gore conceded and his concession is one of the most patriotic acts ever. \n",

He “accidentally” put in ones several sizes larger than she asked for. She looked ridiculous. She was eventually able to get them replaced with the correct size, but for months she was a tiny woman with huge, cartoonish boobs just cause this asshole thought it looked better. She never sued, but I wish she had. That man should not have a license to work. Who knows how many women he’s done that to. \n",

While at the end of the day, you have autonomy over your body, the surgeon has autonomy over their body and what they can be forced to do.

When combined with the clusterfuck that is the modern healthcare system and insurance racket, incredible resentment builds which then becomes a self reinforcing cycle.

      "Comment by Dimpleshenk: I've read a ton of Chomsky and think he is a great intellectual and admire his work. That said, I take a lot of issue with the omissions inherent within his body of work. He is completely focused on the abuses and damages of U.S. policy thoughtout the 20th and now 21st century, but he piles on that topic so single-mindedly that he does not provide balanced or comparative commentary with things being done by other world powers. I know he doesn't subscribe to the idea of Pax Americana, but he rarely discusses the alternatives in-depth at all. Chomsky also will lay out a ton of facts and details about American intervention, abuse, control, hegemony and then leave the reader with nothing when it comes to the question: What should the U.S. actually do instead? What should we do to fix these problems? Chomsky asks big, big questions and then he leaves the answers dangling and empty. It's like he just complains, complains, complains, and then shrugs. Even if his complaints about \"the problem\" are true and well-established, why has his advanced intellect spent so little time and energy on the 2nd half of the equation: The solution to the problem? Chomsky's biggest \"solution\" in many of his books has been simply that we must commit to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Okay, I am on-board with that -- but is that it? That's way too easy and a total cop-out. Chomsky could recommend all sorts of programs for U.S. to reduce intervention, intevene more reponsibily and productively, cooperate with other nations more effectively, reforms in the UN to give its decisions more teeth, reforms to that the US can't easily veto UN decisions, or something. But Chomsky rarely goes into that, just mentioning it briefly and then moving on to his vague \"human rights\" statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Chomsky spends so much time writing about U.S. abuses but doesn't stack them up against the abuses and likely abuses of other major industrialized nations and forces. The U.S. pulled all kinds of shit all over the world to shore up its power, but now China and Russia are spreading their power, cooperating, consolidating, and making major movies to overtake the U.S. And guess what? Both of their governments and political cultures are \\*way\\* more genocidal, authoritarian, and anti-free-speech, anti-freedom-principle (even as lip service) than U.S./Western culture is. Chomsky has acknowledged this at a low level from time to time, but it seems that his \"wheelhouse\" is to pile on about U.S./West abuses and so he avoids comparative issues regarding the other major forces and the benefits of the U.S./West at least being in a position to promote human rights as being vastly preferable to the alternative, which is governments overtaking the U.S./West when they have absolutely no cultural or social concern or incentive to promote human rights whatsoever. In fact we know fully that China, for example, will not only destroy human rights but destroy the free flow of any and all communication while executing and silencing all dissenters with extreme prejucide. Chomsky could at least factor the alternatives into his ongoing, thorough discussions and analysis, but he tends to get really suddenly terse and tight-lipped about those topics, whereas he can fill two-hour lectures with litanies of negative details about things the U.S. did in the 1950s in Laos, or in the early 1970s in Latin America (and again, of course Chomsky is right, and there's nothing inherently wrong with informing people about those topics).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also generally strange how little Chomsky addresses issues about science (such as global warming), religious culture and history (and how that plays into abuses by the U.S. and all other nations), and the highest-level decisions and powers of the International Monetary Fund and other prime movers and shakers. Yes, he describes them and describes what they do, but he gives very little information about what their actual plans might be, who is at the top (name names), what their ideologies are, and the nitty gritty of how they pull strings. Chomsky is always at one particular level of detail -- neither philosophically wide, nor nuts-and-bolts detailed -- but in a general zone of newspaper-level information that describes the basics but doesn't delve into the fine areas. I always read or listen to Chomsky with great interest and hunger, and find myself feeling like he left out the most important questions and details, like he made a road map and said \"now you go figure out the rest, I don't have time to get into the whys and hows, I'm just painting a general picture here.\"\n",

There was a famous case where the ACLU defended the American Nazi Party's right to march down Skokie in 1977.

I mean, the guy has a history of defending North Korea! It does seem, however, that his stance isn't merely default support for anything purported to be left-winged, as it also seems he has a soft spot for authoritarianism. This is possibly why he lauded Donald Trump as a \"statesman of stature\" when he said he would find a diplomatic solution to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which of course means giving in to Russian demands. So, ceding land to Russia must be a double whammy for Chomsky; not only is it run by the former Soviet KGB people but is also deeply authoritarian.

That’s very sensible, because free trade benefits the country with the most power and leverage to use it to its advantage.

People ARE fat, old, bald and repugnant. The joy of reading the stories as a child is the almost-anarchic level of visceral description Dahl offers up, then seeing such characters get their comeuppance. He is part of a tradition of writers going back to the Victorians, and before that to the Grimms and further back to undocumented oral folk story-tellers who unflinchingly told morality tales; nasty things happening to deserving people. This hackneyed neutering is meddling with the very fabric of Dahl's writing.\n",

      "When I was a child, I loved Tintin. My mother and I would read the books (English edition) together when I was little and I would breeze through them when I was a little older. When I was about 12 my mom got me copies of Hergé's two earliest Tintin books, which had not been in print in English for some time. One of them, *Tintin in the Congo*, is one of the most racist books I own. It came with a disclaimer at the front but the content was unaltered. My mom and I had a conversation about it before I read it, and then I read the book. It did not corrupt my mind. I found it interesting. The views that many Europeans had towards Africa as recently as the 1930s stand in stark contrast to how I was raised, and even at 12, I found that very thought-provoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In college, I ended up critically analyzing the book in a lengthy paper which examined how Hergé's attitudes about and approach to depicting other cultures changed over his career. Although *Tintin in the Congo* is certainly not the only Tintin album containing racism or other views that a modern audience would find problematic, had I never read it (the book is so racist it would be difficult to properly censor) I likely would never have written this paper, a process that was an invaluable learning experience for me.\n",

It had a lot of special perks like private tours, getting to meet certain people and visiting areas that generally aren't open to the public. The issue was that it was like a $7,000 trip, and my family was poor as fuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I spent an entire school year fundraising for this trip. I was too young to legally to get an actual part time Job so instead I sold candy bars, sodas and Gatorades at school for a dollar each. Every weekend I either went to Sam's club to stock up on more supplies, then spent the rest of the day walking around the parking lot selling candy and drinks, or I went with my big brother to shoot wild hogs for a local ranch that payed us  $10 for each hog we shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I busted my 13 year old ass raising that money and on 2 seperate occations had huge setbacks because a significant portion of it got stolen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually with summer getting closer I had raised enough, and things were going well, we payed my deposit, had luggage, I had put in the 100 hours of volunteer work, and done the group projects required by the program, my mom even got me a digital camera to take pictures for everyone which was kind of a huge expense for us, the only thing left was to get my passport and I was good to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Texas (I don't know if they still do but they did then) has this stupid fucking law that for a minor to get a passport, they have to have written permission from both biological parents, regardless of the actual relationship the biological parents have with the minor. I have never met my biological father. He knocked up my mom then bounced literally the day she told his she was pregnant. This man had never been a part of my life in any way what so ever, never talked, never wrote a letter, never visited, I didn't even know his name at the time. Still legally had to have written permission from him to get a passport.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my mom reached out months before the deadline of having my passport. Like the deadline was in May, and she tracked him down and started sending letters in September of the previous year, basically as soon as we learned about the requirment. He didn't reply until like the beging of April saying yes, he would send the paperwork. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we waited.. And waited.. And waited.. Never got the paperwork. My trip was canceled, the deposit which was like a quarter of what I raised was non-refundable, all the non-money raising work I put into it like the essays, group projects with the other students and required volunteer work was for nothing. I didnt get to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day after the deadline, we got a letter from this peice of shit saying that \"he didn't feel comfortable letting his child go off across the world and spending money so frivolously\" and how it \"wasn't a good lesson to teach because it didn't require any responsibility\"... He also implied that the money spent on the trip would have been better sent to him because he could actually do something with it and was in greater need of it than we were. Then finally finished it off with \"I want to be a part of your life, you should pay for me to come visit you\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been 15 years and I am still fucking angry over what happened. The only up side was I was able to give my mom the left over money which helped our family out a lot and even then I had to basically force her to take it because she just wouldn't. I ended up having to \"buy\" our old truck from her in order for her to accept it... That and she made me my favorite foods for dinner every day for like a month afterwards, so totally worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: I have been informed that I'm jumping the gun on blaming Texas. Passports are federal level with no state intervention. I apologize for that. Maybe it was over simplified to me as a kid/I didn't fully understand the explanation. I just remeber always being super pissed off as well as my step dad and mom being pissed because he was told his signature was not good enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will have to dig up my birth certificate to see if his name is actually on it. My mom always said he left before I was born but maybe he was there for the begining or something. Can't ask her now because she passed away about 5 years after this happened. Will update with what I find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit again: dug up my birth certificate. His name actually is on it. Don't know what the story with that is. Asked my grandma, she doesn't know, though she confirmed that he wasn't around when I was a baby, and so far as she new, he had left my mom months before I was born. She also confirmed that  she knew for certain that he had 9 kids with 2 other women before he was with my mom, and she had heard that after he left my mom, he had at least 6 more but did not know for sure... So maybe I can form an army of unwanted offspring made up of all my half siblings.\n",

You could, I believe, easily explain to a very young child that works produced in the past contain elements that would not be considered acceptable today, and even that part of their value derives from that very difference.

On the other channels, it was easy enough to cut the scene. It was mainly a musical scene and the performance doesn't actively forward the plot. If you leave in the scene beforehand where the blackface is being applied, the plot still makes sense. TCM not only showed the scene, but discussed it in the intro and outtro of the movie, providing context and a discussion of the history of blackface that was genuinely interesting)\n",

He filled the main character, the setting of the world, established lore, made fun side characters and ended write at the start of the second game.

      "On the other hand, all I can think is this can't be the solution to the traditional publishing problems around author control, profit and new voices. Big authors like Sanderson often help provide the security for publishing houses (theoretically) to buy unknown/debut/smaller authors, and while I do think the funding of authors from publishing houses is often woeful, there's at least a 'pipeline' of sorts to ensure funding goes into 'developing' authors as well. With the biggest names dominating more of the capital from readers, particularly on individual levels like this outside the 'infrastructure' so to speak, it means we might never read the next big name because they don't get published (either they don't have the marketing savvy to be able to promote themselves or don't get picked up by dwindling options with publishers). Books are already increasingly sold to publishers on their existing audience/marketability more than their actual content, I worry a move in this direction will only see that phenomenon get worse (perhaps it's a symptom).\n",

It's true that he never takes true vacations since writing is his hobby, but I believe he typically takes two days off plus another day of non-writing business.

      "------------\n",
      "Comment by simon_thekillerewok: The other answer had some inaccuracies so hopefully this clears things up:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanderson has two publishers in the United States: Tor (Macmillan) and Delacorte Press (Penguin Random House). He also has his international publishers (the biggest of which is Gollancz) . He's also worked with Scholastic in the past and continues to work directly with graphic novel and audiobook publishers. But Tor is the publisher that signed him and the one that publishes (and will continue to publish) his biggest books so for the purposes of this discussion, it's the main one and the one we're talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanderson's contract with his publisher gives him the freedom to create specialty versions of his books that are priced higher so they don't compete with the published versions. So his company, Dragonsteel, has been publishing and selling special leatherbound colllectable editions for quite some time now, which is how the story starts. Last year, based on the recommandation of a friend, he turned to Kickstarter/Backerkit to serve as his pre-order system for the leatherbound editions of his first Stormlight book. Since those editions cost so much, he also wrote a new novella as a lower tier so that most all fans could still participate in the event, which included a bunch of additional swag/goodies and the like. My understanding is that Tor for whatever reason didn't want to publish the novella (maybe because of the time crunch? I do know that Tor is now currently the publisher) so Dragonsteel just did it themselves. Now Brandon's released books for free online before which were later traditionally published (notably [Warbreaker](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/warbreaker-introduction/), and he's done some limited editions for one-off novellas before outside of his main publisher, but this Kickstarter was the first time to my knowledge Dragonsteel did a wide-release of brand new content. The Kickstarter was a wild success, far beyond what you'd expect for a luxury item. At the time, Sanderson said it was reassuring to know that he could explore ways of delivering content directly to his fans instead of going through Amazon and the Big Five. Even though he's not at all controversial or ever likely to be \"cancelled\" he felt better knowing he wasn't under their thumb and no one person could just use their power to wipe his company off the map - he still had an avenue to sell to his fans. He also explained that was part of the reason he had maintained a high-quality newsletter for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The past few years Sanderson's been maintaining an extremely ambitious writing schedule and hitting his deadlines with ease. Which is mostly why the four extra full-length novels are such a surprise. Having written them under no pressure and no contracts, he essentially has the freedom to do what he wants with them, which is why he chose to self-publish (note that these will all eventually be traditionally published as well, most likely by Tor and his standard international partners). Sanderson's explained that he's essentially a co-publisher with Tor as is since he already has control over things like the art. Realize that Sanderson is Tor's biggest author and he was top of the charts (at least for fantasy/scifi) in 2020 so he has a lot of negotiating power. He used Kickstarter last year and it went so smoothly that he decided to use it again this year. That allows him to combine some ideas and give his uberfans a subscription box of goodies/swag in the non-book months. He seems especially excited by the idea that for some fans the books themselves are going to be like subscription boxes - many of the backers won't even know their titles let alone their contents until they receive their copy that month (certainly a unique spin, but when you're as prolific and consistent and well-liked as Sanderson, a book subscription service makes sense). Since they're publishing in-house, they want to make the books as nice as can be so their editions are going to be limited-run \"premium\" editions that traditional publishers would likely never do. Finally some of Sanderson's reasons for self-publishing include things like taking a stand at Amazon's monopoly in publishing as well as trying to get the dinosaur publishers to be more innovative since he's been upset for years that his publisher wouldn't bundle ebooks with print copies (his thinking is that when you buy a book, you should own the words and the status quo isn't consumer friendly). Also his company has an in-house editing and art department that he already works with so there's not too much change there anyway. (For his traditionally published books he'll work with their editors in addition to his own).\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT:\n",
      "\n",
      "And apparently I missed another big reason, Sanderson just said, \"One of the goals for this kickstarter was, secretly, to make Hollywood pay attention.\" So it looks like he'll have some more influence to get his adaptations made now as well.

And these are like firm plans that include specific books and a tentative schedule of when they'll be completed and released (I think it goes into like maybe the 2040s or something). Then there are two cosmere planets that have only been developed through short stories that I'm pretty sure will get at least one of their own full books and maybe a series (can't remember if those were on the schedule or not). So it's more like the plan was to write like a hundred novels and then write a new schedule to try to top the last one. Perhaps the only thing more prolific than Sanderson's pen is his ambition.

You could also start with the mistborn series; depending on your country it will either just be called “mistborn” or “the final empire”. You can also start with the storm light archives with the first book, “the way of kings”. Some might recommend reading Elantris after a couple of his more developed novels, but I think it’s interesting to see his writing develop. Two more tips: save an entire evening for the last 1/4 of each book, and pay really close attention to what a character says if you think their appearance is random. Stay away from the coppermind wiki cause you’ll get some really fun stuff spoiled. And when you start reading, DO NOT post about it or else you might get DMs trying to spoil you.\n",

I’m heavily paraphrasing, but his advice to me was to start writing a little bit each day and slowly work on increasing my word count. As I made progress in my goal to write each day, I would get better and better at writing. The way I took it at the time was that I shouldn’t give up, no matter how bad I felt my writing was.\n",

I ended up asking one of the attendants there how to sign up in the future and she walked me through it, but right as she was finishing explaining how to do it, somehow a gap formed in the line. I’m still not sure why this happened, but no one was coming up due to some admin problem going on.

Sanderson is definitely “hard rules” magic as a resource with limitations like physics, LOTR is very “soft” spiritual powers and principalities type system. Harry Potter is more of a soft mess with a couple logic bones for story structure and a creative jumping point. \n",

      "Comment by None:  It's more about the execution than the actual magic system itself. My favorite system is the one used in the Malazan series which is somewhere between hard and soft magic with a heavy dose of philosophy as well. The rules aren't always explicit and no one really knows what a magical warren is but there are observable laws that explain a lot about the world. In many ways it functions a lot like science in that there is plenty undiscovered but what we have discovered operates on observable principals - \"power draws power\" functions similarly to gravity for instance which also explains why some of the extremely powerful entities in this world are wary of ever using hard power to have their way as it can very easily result in their death. Ultimately it comes down to how the magic system is used within the narrative though. I'm a huge fan of Sanderson and his magic systems are excellent but once we know how the magic system works explaining the specifics of how it is being used during a battle is unnecessary. Like I know this character can fly and how that works so I'd rather the focus be on the aerial fight itself and the life and death struggle than explanations of what lashings they're using to fly around.\n",

The second-largest issue is that she responds to criticism of a book two books later, i.e. book 3 time-turners destroyed in book 5. The movement towards soft magic is probably because of the continuous dissonance between a hard magic system and wholly irrational characters. Hard magic necessitates rational elements because hard magic inevitably results in characters needing to problem solve with their limited magic.\n",

That sounds good, until book sellers go out of business and Amazon reigns as god of the book retail market.
