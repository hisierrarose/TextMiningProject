(Besides Scat is even about eating poop!!! It’s the act of using feces for sexual gratification, for some that’s eating it, for others it’s smearing.) For such a vulgar sex act, why doesn’t the book talk about the leather/kink community which is a vastly important part of the queer community?? It’s almost as if the book wasn’t written by a gay man at all. Not a single mention of the Leather Pride flag or Folsom Street Fair or IML..but by god there is scat?\n",

When I finished I couldn't figure out why it was banned, so I did so research and the scene that got it banned didn't even register with me.  I didn't even remember it was in the book.  I was a HS librarian so I'm pretty sensitive to what might make people freak out, but I honestly didn't get it.  I think the problem with this book was it's exploration of working class Mexican Americans and the rich people in their community.  I found the book very entertaining, and I know nothing about lawn care/landscaping so that was interesting too.\n",

      "The only possible trouble those books might cause that I can see is a younger sibling reading them - like a 7-year-old and having questions. Because there are so many pictures a younger child could take an interest. Someone would need to answer the questions and some parents might prefer keeping their kids ignorant or indoctrinated about that stuff a while longer. Both books are coming of age stories with some gay characters, bullying and hypocritical adults in them. Middle and high schoolers know this stuff already. Flamer won awards and is very well-designed. Blankets is more all over the place and autobiographical. The town revolted against the conservatives and they quit the school board. I am not the south.\n",

I enjoy reading graphic novels and I have an art background but this is not the typical subject matter I choose. I liked it and as expected, the “controversial“ content was largely taken out of context in public criticism. It was a touching memoir and I felt like there was an untold story about autism woven throughout.   \n",

      "At its core, the book was about exploration forced upon someone because they never seemed to fit the norm in any space they occupied. That can be a really relatable story but all the public commentary focused on a few cherry picked scenes that were more awkward moments than anything. That and people being appalled at the extensive exploration of gender and sexual (or lack of) labels / titles, etc. It is a really good indie style graphic novel that became a household name because of pearl clutching nonsense, and I don’t think that is a bad thing.\n",

Hitler really needed an editor, among other things. But it did help me understand how the fascist works, which was a helpful insight I think\n",

      "The Kama sutra: genuinely extremely helpful. For a fourteen year old boy in Mississippi who got most of his knowledge about sex from porn, this book was far and away the healthiest depiction of intimacy and sexual relationships I’d seen in my life, and included a lot of very helpful information. Put it this way: every girl I’ve ever been intimate with benefited from my having read this book. \n",

Horrific book, do not read without nose plugs to block out the garbage stench. \n",

      "However, when I read The Chocolate War by Robert Cormeir, the heartbreaking depictions of bullying and gang violence with a dark realistic ending had triggered my reoccurring thoughts of depression and suicide as an autistic teen girl that was bullied just like Jerry Renualt. Granted, I didn't commit suicide-but I was cutting in HS unbeknownst to my teacher shortly after reading because I didn't have an adult to help me cope with the emotional trauma. When my parents found out, they regretted not being there to help and mentor their older teen child with bullying and severe depression from a story that's old enough to be my uncle; and from a guy that wouldn't fully understand how literature can change our mental health and beliefs until the parents and students complained. Banned books have made me even more intelligent than ever; but for students under 18- having a teacher or a trustworthy adult helping you with triggering content that you connect with, can protect your mental health from having severe consequences. Learning should be engaging, not abusive, or too frustrating.\n",

It's insane that happened in America, in my lifetime, but it did. The comic itself, not my thing, didn't care for the art and the subject matter was pretty cringe.

But because I couldn't change things, I said as little as possible or asked my girlfriends for information. After I'd learned quite a lot, Mother once said to me, \"Anne, let me give you some good advice. Never discuss this with boys, and if they bring it up, don't answer them.\n",

I thought they were perfectly appropriate for middle school or high school. I remember reading books with sexual themes or even sex in them beginning in middle school—some I got from my own school’s library. That’s a time in your life when you begin wondering about that stuff, and I always felt like books were a safe place to expand your horizons.

Most of my classmates were reacting as you would imagine a bunch of 12-13 year old kids would, but I took I seriously.  I felt like I was being entrusted with something precious. I'd read books with adult themes and steamy scenes, drugs and violence. I'd been raiding my dad's steven King books since I was eight or so. But our teachers made it a point to say \"These books are banned, because some adults don't think you can handle them. I think you can be mature enough to look past the parts that make us giggle, and see the story as a whole\" (paraphrasing, but that's the gist) and I took that responsibility seriously.

If the best books in english are water flowing down a smooth hill, those written in German are more a beautiful staircase.  (I do not know what the cause is either.  Is it the translation itself, or that the German language encourages such rigidity?  Is it a style choice or other similar convention that is simply not popular in the books I read?)\n",

Marx's approach to history is very clearly attempting to do for it what Newton did for physics--come up with a predictive theory for what happens next, having seen the French Revolution and how it changed Europe. In that, the theory of class struggle and the prediction of the polarization of society into the bourgeois and proletariat is an interesting model. \n",

      "And The Band Played On by Randy Shilts: AIDS is gay history, present, and future. Shilts lived in the 80s and witnessed how AIDS effected the gay community first hand eventually dying from the disease itself. It is a wildly important book for gay history and sincerely puts things in perspective. That being said, many have criticized his coinage of “patient o.” In the book he credits one man to spreading the virus horrendously; modern science says he could have not have started it. Still a very good read!\n",

If you’ve seen Bohemian Rhapsody, this book will open your eyes: he was not as innocent as the movie shows! (He literally wore a shirt for a gay sex club in one of his music videos (The Mineshaft!))\n",

      "Unlimited Intimacy by Tim Dean: This one is controversial, but I love it. Looking at hardcore gay pornography of the late 90s, early 2000s, Dr. Dean analyzes how gay men have sex. Once men began to realize HIV/AIDS was no longer a serious threat, that due to medicine men no longer dropped like flies, gay men started to have unprotected sex. The book, to me, is wildly important because it discusses things other scholars would greatly ignore. Since this book’s release, PrEP has been approved and now barebacking is extremely common with gay men. That being said, I loved this book because it was insight in how a stigmatized community could find love and desire with each other.\n",

Out of curiosity, I looked up It as well. What I learned is that people are less offended by children being murdered than abused, which I still find fascinating and hilarious, in a fucked up kind of way. I don't remember it well, but I'm pretty sure there's some kind of group sex scene with like eleven year olds in It, but Lolita is still more controversial. So weird.

Main Kampf on the other hand is primarily going to be translated by people wanting to convey the propaganda but not make the message sound appealing. They may not take as much care to make sure it sounds good and flows well. Hitler was a renowned orator and public speaker so I have a hard time believing that his written works wouldn't be well written.\n",

In most school districts there aren't separate libraries for different students; everyone uses the same library. In some school districts there isn't a special school library at all and everyone uses the public library which gains some extra funding from the school district in compensation.

      "If a book is banned from a district library it isn't allowed in the entire system - if a kindergartener can't access it then a senior can't either, and vice versa. Thus a book being banned means that no one can check it out at all; some districts restrict books, but that simply limits the book's ability to be shared and loaned, nothing is stopping a kindergartener from walking into the high school's library, pulling a restricted book off the shelf, and reading it while still inside the library - they just may not be allowed to check out the book.\n",

None of these titles would ever be found in anything other than a high school library or high school English classroom library, so banning them for elementary and middle schools is pointless theatre. The ultimate decision makers for what students should be allowed to read are their parents, not lawmakers or politicians or school board members. If a parent doesn't want their student reading \"What Girls Are Made Of\", that's their choice. However, they don't get to make that choice for other people's children. School libraries curate their collections very carefully for elementary school, a bit less so for middle school. But by the time high school rolls around, most of these students will have seen and read so much on the internet that these books won't be the gateway to corruption many adults seem to think they are, and so library collections are much more inclusive of adult titles. Motivating modern kids to read books when faced with the easy addictive scrolling of social media means showing them reality, however grim and NSFW that might seem. Therefore, if you don't want your student reading certain types of material, then YOU, as a parent, need to read what your child is reading and make a decision for YOUR own child alone, not anyone else's. What might be one person's ~~pornography~~ erotica or immorality might be another's life-changing read.\n",

So, I immediately read all those and my English teacher let it be known he would be having coffee at the coffee shop that was kind of kiddy corner to the Tower theater back then at a certain time. And like 1/3 of the class showed up b/c it was a nerd class and we talked about the books. To this day I can't figure out why the Plague was banned. The Wife's Tale had a little bit of hanky panky but it read to me like an elaborate fart joke. That's when I realized the people who ban books don't read books and are idiots.

If I could, I'd ban the Twilight series from the school library I work in. I find the books to be badly written, and feel they push a bad narrative regarding relationships. They get checked out by the students at my school a lot, and some kids that might not otherwise choose to read for pleasure are drawn to these books and go through the whole series. I cringe inside every time I check one out to a student, but it's what they want to read, and who am I to stop them? They're not my children. It's not my call.\n",

The courts have pretty consistently granted that the state at times has a compelling interest to act in a way with minors during school hours that would normally be otherwise unconstitutional. It's certainly not unrestricted, students do have rights, but not the same rights (in other areas they have more protections than an adult might have).\n",

      "The most relevant case law that I am familiar with is Island Trees Union Free School District v. Pico (1982), but it's been some time since I've looked at the particulars. The basic gist of it is that local school boards have broad discretion to manage the materials and curriculum in the school with certain restrictions. The tricky part is that these restrictions are a bit nebulous, and in this particular case I'm not sure how the courts would rule because the wording hinges on 3 or more school boards triggering a statewide ban. I would imagine the individual boards banning would be upheld by the courts, but I don't know what they would say about some board enacting a statewide policy. \n",

      "It seems clearly designed to try and be a workaround via Pico based on how it's worded (i.e. the state legislature is not banning them, school boards are!) but because of that its a pretty slippery attempt to follow the letter of the law while overstepping its intended spirit.

Any gullible idiot should be able to read whatever they want whenever they want. They may prosper or succumb to whatever they happen to choose to do, just as any other American can. I, myself, fell in love with some guy Terry's books. Great author. But if Terry told me I needed a sex change or that I needed to buy into crypto to support the patriarchy, then I would step away. I was thankfully raised to not be too gullible, but some are not. Don't ban books.

And the fire in her belly, which had burned like the forges of Rearden Steel, began to dwindle to a flicker, choked by the ashes of a world that scorned the righteous labor of its artisans.  She saw the looters in the marketplace, they that neither sowed nor reaped, yet did they devour the harvest of others’ toil.  And the words of John Galt echoed in her soul, a prophet's cry in the wilderness of fools: “I will stop the motor of the world.”  And Dagny, she knew then that the time of reckoning was at hand, that the wheat must be separated from the chaff, and that the strong, they that bore the world upon their shoulders, must depart from the parasitic swarm, lest all be dragged down into the abyss of sloth and decay.

Moral absolutism crumbles in the real world. Similarly if I publish a book that is a list of names and addressed of you, your family members, and your friends titled \"People who should be killed with axes\" somehow I think you'd be fine with that getting banned regardless of whether it took the form of a book instead of a threatening message online.

Sometimes they are good processes, sometimes they are too lax. That itself may show flaws (police brutality) or unbelievably necessary (nuclear weapons and biological strands). And both states can suddenly shift, look at a Putin or Peter Thiel holding nuclear weapons key or biological weapons and soon we see why it's not that good a government having that prerrogative, while a Police Force can be the difference between victims and survivors in unstable countries. \n",

      "If there's limitation of backgrounds you can access a book, without banning it (like being a scholar), while at the same time demanding that access to it accompanies access to arguments against it (and every public defense of it also legally requires a equally public defense of the opposite back) you can both counteract spread of misinformation while at the same time hindering any attempt of control by people who take advantage on spreading said lies.\n",

      "Controlled exposure to low levels is better than exposure to no level whatsoever, because one of these scenarios the population is adequately immune to fight off contraction.

Because CONSPIRACY, now give me money and power\". \n",

      "Library _curation_, however, is an important and valuable tool. A librarian for a grade school, for example, should be choosing materials that support the mission of the school and are appropriate (in both level and content) for grade-school kids. A librarian for a grade school that was including books with actually explicit sex scenes is not doing a very good job; but the same librarian might reasonably include a book that discusses the existence of incest in an age-appropriate way. And that might even include a fictional story where it's clear that characters are in an incestuous relationship (like a story which mentions a person being pregnant with their Uncle's child or the like).\n",

      "Parents challenging a school library's inclusion of material as not age-appropriate is a reasonable and important capability to offer; and that's true even though many pearl-clutching parents would like to abuse that process to \"protect\" their kids from having access to material they merely disagree with.\n",

      "When you combine abuse of process with laws that make the process easier to abuse, and you turn loose a subculture that thinks the mere mention of something like homosexuality or trans people is automatically \"sexually explicit\", you get problems. Those problems are amplified dramatically when the same subculture doesn't understand that sex and sexual content -- in both fiction and non-fiction contexts -- are actually age-appropriate (though of course there is some room to discuss exactly how explicit such materials can be before they're _not_ appropriate) much earlier than their personal morality suggests.\n",

When the Egyptians slaughter the Hebrew children due to an Egyptian prophecy that the Hebrews would destroy the kingdom, God saves the prophesied child and sends him to be adopted by the royal family. Drawn from the river is Moses. Once Moses learns he is Hebrew and kills a slave master, he flees Egypt for Semitic lands.\n",

God knows that Moses' adoptive brother that now rules as Pharaoh will exonerate him of any wrongdoing. Which the Pharaoh does, forgiving past *and future* crimes. Moses asks for the Hebrews to be freed and is laughed at, but the laughing stops when the plagues begin. The Nile is turned against the Egyptians, their crops fail, and their livestock perish. Soon, Pharaoh is ready to let the Hebrews go; so severe is the power of God and so great the suffering of Egypt. What happens then?\n",

Which God turns back upon the Egyptians with Passover and the Angel of Death. Finally, Pharaoh releases the Hebrews, and they make their way out of Egypt.\n",

      "And then God hardens Pharaoh's heart *again*. Pharaoh sends an *army* after the Hebrews to destroy them.

And when Pharaoh's heart is hardened again, he sends his army the same route, where God consumes them. Pharaoh is left alone and Egypt is destroyed.\n",

You shall know My pain.\" Pharaoh shall hear his people cry for salvation, and see his own beloved children die. For *that* is what it means to be a god.

By offering his daughters he is making the best of a bad situation, but he is still doing something bad. There is often ironic reversal through narrative patterns throughout the Bible. He offers his daughters to the population against their will and is willing to dishonor them, and later on they use him against his will by getting him drunk and dishonor him in the false belief that they are honoring and continuing his line.

Since your connection to God has been disrupted, rather than asking God for help, you ask it's emissaries how to go about repairing that connection.

No one is disputing that there is a lot of literature with content that is not appropriate for children and teens, and therefore not admissible to public school libraries. The problem is those that are choosing what content is acceptable or not for children. Sherman Alexie’s *The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,* which chronicles a child of Native American decent struggling with growing up in poverty on a reservation, is considered “not appropriate,” for teens because it mentions taboo topics such as racism and going through puberty and exploring masturbation. Crap teens already know more than enough about anyway. Or a book like *Boy Meets Boy,* or *Heartstopper,* which are completely benign books that help questioning teens understand that they’re not so different and shouldn’t feel alienated because they feel a certain way. Books that also tactfully tackle topics such as prejudice, homophobia, sexual assault, eating disorders. All real life problems that kids absolutely face every day. And those kids deserve access to those helpful books, despite anything their parents believe, because lots of children are raised in abusive, unsupportive, and unstable homes.\n",

I didn't read much by lgbtqia+ because it just wasn't nearly as well represented, but I do now and... well, I am still straight. Children should have access to literature that interests them and supports their reading level. I had a college grade reading level in middle school and read books that wouldn't be considered appropriate, but it didn't change me. Just made me want to read more, learn more about other people and places and views. Also, as hard as we may try to sanitize schools and whatnot, we also have the internet to contend with. Unfortunately, kids will see things that they aren't ready for yet, but it is up to the parents to treat their children with enough respect to have a conversation and educate them as needed.

This is a very big deal, and is nearly unprecedented in American political practice. \n",

This has been pretty common and consistent, and is generally what has been meant by \"banned books\" in the past.

Books have faced bans and removals and being made inaccessible all over the country for decades. Exactly zero bans have been placed on The Turner Diaries. I'm not sure what constitutes KKK propaganda in your mind–new member handouts? But I would expect a good library to offer access to material like The Turner Diaries and the Protocols of Zion and the KKK. Exactly none of that is held at public school libraries for kids. Many libraries have copies of Birth of a Nation, the silent movie that is wildly racist and  shows the KKK as heroes. It was at one point the most popular film in US history...until it was beaten out by Gone With The Wind. (Read the novel and you'll discover Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes were taking part in some lovely KKK-style terrorizing of people the night they went out and got injured and had to pretend to be drunk when those darn Yankees checked up on them to see if they'd taken part). And all those libraries have copies of the novel Gone With The Wind. Libraries are not meant to be places where only the books I approve of can be found. Or only the books you approve of. How about you pay attention to what your kids read and let other parents do the same? And talk to your local librarian. They're not some monster trying to force filth on your child.

Therefore, it makes sense that it would be appropriate for kids of her age to read about it. \n",

Yes, the edited version of her diary is usually assigned in schools, because that was the initial version to be published, and because it is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter. However, I’m not sure how you’re failing to grasp that just because the edited version is typically assigned in schools, that doesn’t mean the unedited version is banned or censored in those schools. There would be no consequence, in places without book bans, for stocking the unedited version in the library or bringing it into a classroom. Also, I find your obsessive focus on the masturbation sequences of the diary to be, frankly, weird as hell. These represent a couple brief passages in the diary, out of hundreds and hundreds of pages. Anne Frank was not writing porn, she was writing about her lived experience as a teenage girl, and I think it’s extremely important for young people to learn and read about sex and sexuality, just as important as it is to learn about war and genocide.\n",

If we’re not going to put every book up for a vote of approval to the electorate, I’d rather leave it to the librarians, who typically take into consideration such factors as what books teachers, parents, and students are requesting be included in the library, what’s being checked out more than others, what might be of interest and appropriate for the student body, and other similar considerations when curating a particular library.\n",

The most well known \"throuple\" were Valor I (male), Valor II (male), and Hope (female) who raised several sets of chicks together. Sadly Hope died when a pair of other bald eagles attacked the nest, but Valor I and Valor II stayed together and raised the chicks on their own.

      "It's not as simple as that.  Yes, there has been oppression against LGBT+ from a range of conservative groups (though recent years have seen improvement). But what is missing is an understanding of how some conservative sentiments against *libertine* behaviors, a term with value to conservatives, relate  to general progressive trends and not necessarily to LGBT+ (though, yes, acknowledging that some assert LGBT+ link).\n",
      "\n",
      "Most notable are the 1960s Sexual Revolution and the simultaneous rise of drug culture. Both were largely progressive-driven. Conservatives opposed most of this, which continues in various ways today:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Public use and glorification of hard drugs (many progressives oppose drug enforcement). Heavy intoxication has long linked to promiscuity and extreme or risky sexual acts, such as multiple partners at the same times and ignoring condom use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Overt sexuality, including a decline of rules limiting explicit sexuality on TV. We see increasingly nudity and people simulating screwing (\"twerking\") during entertainment shows (non-cable TV);\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Expansion of porn (increasingly accessible to children). It's getting more explicit and degrading towards women. (Women pressured into ATM sex. Really?) There is significant connection between porn and sex trafficking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) More men badgering/harassing women for sex, e.g., the *Me Too* movement. Obviously many conservative men are sex offenders, but conservatives, as a class, see that too much tolerance on sexuality creates more *open space* for abuse of women. Many progressives dismiss this; indeed they champion the subculture of music that refers to women as \"bitches and hos\" (prostitutes) and dismiss conservative complaints about a linkage between this music and mistreatment of women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, prejudice against LGBT+ has been a big conservative fault, but progressive dismissal of conservatives' *protect-children-with-moral-standards* stance as hate-based and incoherent is off base. Many progressives today push \"Sex Positivity:\"\n",

All really stupid reasons. Banning a book about gay penguins (based on a TRUE STORY! Those penguins really did mate and adopt a chick the zookeepers gave them!) because you don't like gay people is dumb, especially since gay marriage is legal and many of the kids who go to the school may have gay parents. We have hundreds upon hundreds of picture books about straight people, can't children of gay couples see families like theirs too?\n",

      "“Ban” does not mean “illegal”. The federal government  can ban something, sure, but parents can ban their child from dating, schools can ban books from their own personal libraries, a state could ban books from schools but not their public libraries, etc. Books being available through other methods doesn’t mean that someone hasn’t banned them from a particular setting. They’re still books that have been banned/prohibited/forbidden in some context.\n",

It can be debated whether she is \"right\" or \"wrong\" but it is not debatable that she scoffed at the law and the district policy, both of which are things she signed a contract to abide by when hired. If you wanna change the rules, go out and VOTE and change them, but you do not take the law into your own hands just because you disagree with it and expect to come up roses afterwards. That's just hubris. Teachers are government employees that are supposed to be trusted community figures. When one goes rogue and acts against the will of the people AS DECIDED BY THE LAW, they can no longer be trusted. If you think the law sucks, that's an argument, but it's not an argument for government employees to make their own rules. You know this, but fight back because you just don't like it.

I know there was the David Lynch version from 1984, so no doubt there are some tie in paperback versions from then. Alejandro Jodorowsky was working on an adaptation in the 70s but AFAIK it never left pre-production, and I think there was an attempt in the late 70s to get Ridley Scott to do one, but I don't think it was ever more than a script.\n",

It was a bit of a shock to discover how much criticism his books receive.  Thinking back, I can see why.  His writing style can be a bit clunky at times, and the plots, while exciting, can be a little far-fetched.  It's similar to The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in a way.  If you're new to that type of story, it can feel profound.  But if you're already well-read, you might find it a bit simplistic.  For me, Brown's books were a great introduction to thrillers, but my tastes have definitely evolved since then.\n",

      "\n",
      "> In the sacred halls of the ancient library, where the light of knowledge danced upon the walls like the shadows of Da Vinci's secret codes, Robert Langdon found himself before an enigma that would challenge even the most brilliant minds of modern times. The mystery: multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Langdon's expert fingers traced the symbols on the parchment. Before him lay not the Fibonacci Sequence, but something more primal, more universal. It was the very essence of growth, of expansion, of the universe's own heartbeat—multiplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Multiplication,\" he whispered, his voice barely a breath over the silent reverence of the library, \"is not merely a mathematical operation; it's a symphony of numbers, a dance of digits where each participant holds the key to the next level of understanding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> He imagined the numbers as ancient symbols, each with its own history, its own story. Consider, for instance, the humble number three. Alone, it was a mere whisper in the vastness of numerical eternity. But when paired with another number, say five, through the arcane ritual of multiplication, a transformation occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Three times five,\" Langdon murmured, his mind conjuring images of three groups, each holding five golden apples from Newton's orchard. \"Fifteen,\" he concluded, the answer emerging like a revelation from the shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "> But multiplication, he knew, was more than just the accumulation of apples or the multiplication of light through prisms. It was a code, a pattern that repeated itself in the spirals of galaxies, in the growth rings of trees, in the very structure of DNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"Every multiplication,\" Langdon explained to an unseen audience, \"is a gateway to understanding the universe's scale. When you multiply, you are not just calculating; you are scaling the heights of knowledge, from the microcosms to the macrocosms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "> He envisioned a scenario where numbers were characters in a grand narrative. Two, multiplied by itself, became four, an echo of the dual nature of light as both particle and wave. Eight times nine, a cryptic passage leading to seventy-two, the number of names of God in some mystical traditions.\n",

Angels and Demons was good but didn’t quite inspire the same intensity, and by the third book, I figured out the bad guy in less than 20 pages.

      "A lot of the controversy, I believe, came from the way his first real hit, *The Da Vinci Code*, was presented. Before the opening of the story, there is the \"facts\" page claiming that the Priory of Sion was real and descriptions of art, architecture, secret rituals, etc... are historically accurate. I think now it is acknowledged as part of the fictional work, but is not clearly indicated as such. And while promoting the book, Brown claimed that this history presented is entirely accurate (far from it). Obviously, historians and people who care about history do not like fictional history presented as real history, even as background for a fictional story. If he hadn't kept insisting that his made-up background to the story was actual real history, I don't expect there would have been so much backlash.\n",

Some ideas are so entrenched so as to not need defending because they are assumed true de facto while contrasting opinions require mountains of articulate evidence to argue a counternarrative.

At my library, the only reason that a donated book ends up on the shelf is if the book is already in high demand and we can make use of an extra copy. In this case, my library already has several copies of _Mein Kampf_, including multiple translations, commentaries, and annotated editions putting it in historical context.

I prefer storygraph since the reviews are just there and you can't really do anything with them except for read them. Also the .25, .5 and .75 star ratings definitely help.

The best way to use Goodreads to find new books is by following reviewers whose opinions you trust and seeing what books they like and dislike, and that's where the number of users on Goodreads is the real strength.

Biden wants international sanctions on Russia for invading a country and killing massive amounts of civilians, but gives Israel a complete pass. He’s undermining the international system that the US championed. \n",

Biden doesn’t need to pass any new laws; he just has to follow the existing Lehy Law that says aid must be suspended if the recipient is committing war crimes. Another federal law says   Aid can’t be given to any country that blocks US humanitarian aid from being delivered and Israel is in violation of both. Biden is openly ignoring these laws and they are making him politically unpopular by doing so. It would strengthen the US’ standing among our allies in the Middle East AND Europe, as well as with multiple factions inside Israel who are angry that Netanyahu doesn’t care about the hostages and is turning down deals to return them all home.\n",

It is also a fact that more people in florida went to the polls with the intent to vote for Gore (see the butterfly ballot on Wikipedia for those who don’t know). But, under the rules, Bush won Florida but within the margin for a mandatory recount. After the mandatory recount (which turns out was just running ballots through the machines again), Gore was still behind, but within the margin where he could ask for a hand recount (see hanging chad on Wikipedia for an explanation on why this could change the outcome).  In what in hindsight was a major tactical error by his campaign, Gore requested recounts in Democratic counties. He was picking up votes and was within 500 votes of taking the lead when the Supreme Court, in a decision many legal scholars considered up there with Dred Scott on the list of bad Supreme Court decisions, stopped the counting and installed Bush. Gore conceded and his concession is one of the most patriotic acts ever. \n",

      "Turns out, had Gore asked for a full recount of all Florida ballots, he would have won Florida and the Presidency. A consortium of newspapers spent the summer after the election counting all Florida ballots by hand in order to determine the real winner of Florida.

I put on a big smile and charged out: \"Hey, First name Middle name, finally found your way down here, Sir?\" Pissed my DP off to no end. Wanted to find something to write me up about. I talked my way out of it by explaining that by being so close to the CEO, I was actually giving our division additional pull from an IT perspective.

I also do not believe the tissues would even heal correctly, suturing healthy tissue to itself would lead to a long healing time and probably would not close secondary to the tension the tissue would be under. \n",

Years later I read that this practice was what caused Rosemary Kennedy to have brain damage, although this was because they made her wait for several hours to be born.

When combined with the clusterfuck that is the modern healthcare system and insurance racket, incredible resentment builds which then becomes a self reinforcing cycle. Patients’ want their needs met and to feel safe while healthcare workers want to provide that care (which is why most go into it in the first place) while being respected for their expertise and often the sacrifice required to achieve it.

      "Comment by Dimpleshenk: I've read a ton of Chomsky and think he is a great intellectual and admire his work. That said, I take a lot of issue with the omissions inherent within his body of work. He is completely focused on the abuses and damages of U.S. policy thoughtout the 20th and now 21st century, but he piles on that topic so single-mindedly that he does not provide balanced or comparative commentary with things being done by other world powers. I know he doesn't subscribe to the idea of Pax Americana, but he rarely discusses the alternatives in-depth at all. Chomsky also will lay out a ton of facts and details about American intervention, abuse, control, hegemony and then leave the reader with nothing when it comes to the question: What should the U.S. actually do instead? What should we do to fix these problems? Chomsky asks big, big questions and then he leaves the answers dangling and empty. It's like he just complains, complains, complains, and then shrugs. Even if his complaints about \"the problem\" are true and well-established, why has his advanced intellect spent so little time and energy on the 2nd half of the equation: The solution to the problem? Chomsky's biggest \"solution\" in many of his books has been simply that we must commit to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Okay, I am on-board with that -- but is that it? That's way too easy and a total cop-out. Chomsky could recommend all sorts of programs for U.S. to reduce intervention, intevene more reponsibily and productively, cooperate with other nations more effectively, reforms in the UN to give its decisions more teeth, reforms to that the US can't easily veto UN decisions, or something. But Chomsky rarely goes into that, just mentioning it briefly and then moving on to his vague \"human rights\" statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Chomsky spends so much time writing about U.S. abuses but doesn't stack them up against the abuses and likely abuses of other major industrialized nations and forces. The U.S. pulled all kinds of shit all over the world to shore up its power, but now China and Russia are spreading their power, cooperating, consolidating, and making major movies to overtake the U.S. And guess what? Both of their governments and political cultures are \\*way\\* more genocidal, authoritarian, and anti-free-speech, anti-freedom-principle (even as lip service) than U.S./Western culture is. Chomsky has acknowledged this at a low level from time to time, but it seems that his \"wheelhouse\" is to pile on about U.S./West abuses and so he avoids comparative issues regarding the other major forces and the benefits of the U.S./West at least being in a position to promote human rights as being vastly preferable to the alternative, which is governments overtaking the U.S./West when they have absolutely no cultural or social concern or incentive to promote human rights whatsoever. In fact we know fully that China, for example, will not only destroy human rights but destroy the free flow of any and all communication while executing and silencing all dissenters with extreme prejucide. Chomsky could at least factor the alternatives into his ongoing, thorough discussions and analysis, but he tends to get really suddenly terse and tight-lipped about those topics, whereas he can fill two-hour lectures with litanies of negative details about things the U.S. did in the 1950s in Laos, or in the early 1970s in Latin America (and again, of course Chomsky is right, and there's nothing inherently wrong with informing people about those topics).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also generally strange how little Chomsky addresses issues about science (such as global warming), religious culture and history (and how that plays into abuses by the U.S. and all other nations), and the highest-level decisions and powers of the International Monetary Fund and other prime movers and shakers. Yes, he describes them and describes what they do, but he gives very little information about what their actual plans might be, who is at the top (name names), what their ideologies are, and the nitty gritty of how they pull strings. Chomsky is always at one particular level of detail -- neither philosophically wide, nor nuts-and-bolts detailed -- but in a general zone of newspaper-level information that describes the basics but doesn't delve into the fine areas. I always read or listen to Chomsky with great interest and hunger, and find myself feeling like he left out the most important questions and details, like he made a road map and said \"now you go figure out the rest, I don't have time to get into the whys and hows, I'm just painting a general picture here.\"\n",

It only opened up its economy to the world after World War 2, when it was by far the richest and most powerful country in the world. That’s very sensible, because free trade benefits the country with the most power and leverage to use it to its advantage.

When I was about 12 my mom got me copies of Hergé's two earliest Tintin books, which had not been in print in English for some time. One of them, *Tintin in the Congo*, is one of the most racist books I own. It came with a disclaimer at the front but the content was unaltered. My mom and I had a conversation about it before I read it, and then I read the book. It did not corrupt my mind. I found it interesting. The views that many Europeans had towards Africa as recently as the 1930s stand in stark contrast to how I was raised, and even at 12, I found that very thought-provoking.\n",

The issue was that it was like a $7,000 trip, and my family was poor as fuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I spent an entire school year fundraising for this trip. I was too young to legally to get an actual part time Job so instead I sold candy bars, sodas and Gatorades at school for a dollar each. Every weekend I either went to Sam's club to stock up on more supplies, then spent the rest of the day walking around the parking lot selling candy and drinks, or I went with my big brother to shoot wild hogs for a local ranch that payed us  $10 for each hog we shot.\n",

      "I busted my 13 year old ass raising that money and on 2 seperate occations had huge setbacks because a significant portion of it got stolen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually with summer getting closer I had raised enough, and things were going well, we payed my deposit, had luggage, I had put in the 100 hours of volunteer work, and done the group projects required by the program, my mom even got me a digital camera to take pictures for everyone which was kind of a huge expense for us, the only thing left was to get my passport and I was good to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Texas (I don't know if they still do but they did then) has this stupid fucking law that for a minor to get a passport, they have to have written permission from both biological parents, regardless of the actual relationship the biological parents have with the minor. I have never met my biological father. He knocked up my mom then bounced literally the day she told his she was pregnant. This man had never been a part of my life in any way what so ever, never talked, never wrote a letter, never visited, I didn't even know his name at the time. Still legally had to have written permission from him to get a passport.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my mom reached out months before the deadline of having my passport. Like the deadline was in May, and she tracked him down and started sending letters in September of the previous year, basically as soon as we learned about the requirment. He didn't reply until like the beging of April saying yes, he would send the paperwork. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we waited.. And waited.. And waited.. Never got the paperwork. My trip was canceled, the deposit which was like a quarter of what I raised was non-refundable, all the non-money raising work I put into it like the essays, group projects with the other students and required volunteer work was for nothing. I didnt get to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day after the deadline, we got a letter from this peice of shit saying that \"he didn't feel comfortable letting his child go off across the world and spending money so frivolously\" and how it \"wasn't a good lesson to teach because it didn't require any responsibility\"... He also implied that the money spent on the trip would have been better sent to him because he could actually do something with it and was in greater need of it than we were. Then finally finished it off with \"I want to be a part of your life, you should pay for me to come visit you\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been 15 years and I am still fucking angry over what happened.

I ended up having to \"buy\" our old truck from her in order for her to accept it... That and she made me my favorite foods for dinner every day for like a month afterwards, so totally worth it!\n",

      "Edit: I have been informed that I'm jumping the gun on blaming Texas. Passports are federal level with no state intervention. I apologize for that.

      "\n",
      "Edit again: dug up my birth certificate. His name actually is on it. Don't know what the story with that is. Asked my grandma, she doesn't know, though she confirmed that he wasn't around when I was a baby, and so far as she new, he had left my mom months before I was born. She also confirmed that  she knew for certain that he had 9 kids with 2 other women before he was with my mom, and she had heard that after he left my mom, he had at least 6 more but did not know for sure...

You could, I believe, easily explain to a very young child that works produced in the past contain elements that would not be considered acceptable today, and even that part of their value derives from that very difference.

It's like standing in a landscape where everything more than 5 metres distant has been erased or blurred to the point of indistinction. There are many political reasons why this would be beneficial to anyone who might want to ensure obedience, lack of curiosity, or simple ignorance of what is happening around them.

It's a classic shake-down operation - 'say/write this (or better still: hire us to write it) or else.'

(I wasn't there - this is not personal nostalgia!) You could equally make the argument that today's sensitivity advisers, self-appointed censors and activists are in fact dining out on the concrete advances made in past generations - they have professionalised those disinterested political currents and turned them into job opportunities while in fact changing very little for the better, and arguably much for the worse.\n",

He filled the main character, the setting of the world, established lore, made fun side characters and ended write at the start of the second game.

      "On the other hand, all I can think is this can't be the solution to the traditional publishing problems around author control, profit and new voices. Big authors like Sanderson often help provide the security for publishing houses (theoretically) to buy unknown/debut/smaller authors, and while I do think the funding of authors from publishing houses is often woeful, there's at least a 'pipeline' of sorts to ensure funding goes into 'developing' authors as well. With the biggest names dominating more of the capital from readers, particularly on individual levels like this outside the 'infrastructure' so to speak, it means we might never read the next big name because they don't get published (either they don't have the marketing savvy to be able to promote themselves or don't get picked up by dwindling options with publishers). Books are already increasingly sold to publishers on their existing audience/marketability more than their actual content, I worry a move in this direction will only see that phenomenon get worse (perhaps it's a symptom).\n",

It's true that he never takes true vacations since writing is his hobby, but I believe he typically takes two days off plus another day of non-writing business.

The on demand infrastructure available through kickstarter is better for facilitation on this kind of project (books, audio, digital, swag boxes, etc)\n",

      "------------\n",
      "Comment by simon_thekillerewok: The other answer had some inaccuracies so hopefully this clears things up:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanderson has two publishers in the United States: Tor (Macmillan) and Delacorte Press (Penguin Random House). He also has his international publishers (the biggest of which is Gollancz) . He's also worked with Scholastic in the past and continues to work directly with graphic novel and audiobook publishers. But Tor is the publisher that signed him and the one that publishes (and will continue to publish) his biggest books so for the purposes of this discussion, it's the main one and the one we're talking about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanderson's contract with his publisher gives him the freedom to create specialty versions of his books that are priced higher so they don't compete with the published versions. So his company, Dragonsteel, has been publishing and selling special leatherbound colllectable editions for quite some time now, which is how the story starts. Last year, based on the recommandation of a friend, he turned to Kickstarter/Backerkit to serve as his pre-order system for the leatherbound editions of his first Stormlight book. Since those editions cost so much, he also wrote a new novella as a lower tier so that most all fans could still participate in the event, which included a bunch of additional swag/goodies and the like. My understanding is that Tor for whatever reason didn't want to publish the novella (maybe because of the time crunch? I do know that Tor is now currently the publisher) so Dragonsteel just did it themselves. Now Brandon's released books for free online before which were later traditionally published (notably [Warbreaker](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/warbreaker-introduction/), and he's done some limited editions for one-off novellas before outside of his main publisher, but this Kickstarter was the first time to my knowledge Dragonsteel did a wide-release of brand new content. The Kickstarter was a wild success, far beyond what you'd expect for a luxury item. At the time, Sanderson said it was reassuring to know that he could explore ways of delivering content directly to his fans instead of going through Amazon and the Big Five. Even though he's not at all controversial or ever likely to be \"cancelled\" he felt better knowing he wasn't under their thumb and no one person could just use their power to wipe his company off the map - he still had an avenue to sell to his fans. He also explained that was part of the reason he had maintained a high-quality newsletter for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The past few years Sanderson's been maintaining an extremely ambitious writing schedule and hitting his deadlines with ease. Which is mostly why the four extra full-length novels are such a surprise. Having written them under no pressure and no contracts, he essentially has the freedom to do what he wants with them, which is why he chose to self-publish (note that these will all eventually be traditionally published as well, most likely by Tor and his standard international partners). Sanderson's explained that he's essentially a co-publisher with Tor as is since he already has control over things like the art. Realize that Sanderson is Tor's biggest author and he was top of the charts (at least for fantasy/scifi) in 2020 so he has a lot of negotiating power. He used Kickstarter last year and it went so smoothly that he decided to use it again this year. That allows him to combine some ideas and give his uberfans a subscription box of goodies/swag in the non-book months. He seems especially excited by the idea that for some fans the books themselves are going to be like subscription boxes - many of the backers won't even know their titles let alone their contents until they receive their copy that month (certainly a unique spin, but when you're as prolific and consistent and well-liked as Sanderson, a book subscription service makes sense). Since they're publishing in-house, they want to make the books as nice as can be so their editions are going to be limited-run \"premium\" editions that traditional publishers would likely never do. Finally some of Sanderson's reasons for self-publishing include things like taking a stand at Amazon's monopoly in publishing as well as trying to get the dinosaur publishers to be more innovative since he's been upset for years that his publisher wouldn't bundle ebooks with print copies (his thinking is that when you buy a book, you should own the words and the status quo isn't consumer friendly). Also his company has an in-house editing and art department that he already works with so there's not too much change there anyway. (For his traditionally published books he'll work with their editors in addition to his own).\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT:\n",
      "\n",
      "And apparently I missed another big reason, Sanderson just said, \"One of the goals for this kickstarter was, secretly, to make Hollywood pay attention.\" So it looks like he'll have some more influence to get his adaptations made now as well. (Also as a gamer, he's wanted video game adaptations for years - even wrote a script dedicated for one.)\n",

And these are like firm plans that include specific books and a tentative schedule of when they'll be completed and released (I think it goes into like maybe the 2040s or something). Then there are two cosmere planets that have only been developed through short stories that I'm pretty sure will get at least one of their own full books and maybe a series (can't remember if those were on the schedule or not). So it's more like the plan was to write like a hundred novels and then write a new schedule to try to top the last one. Perhaps the only thing more prolific than Sanderson's pen is his ambition.

You could also start with the mistborn series; depending on your country it will either just be called “mistborn” or “the final empire”. You can also start with the storm light archives with the first book, “the way of kings”. Some might recommend reading Elantris after a couple of his more developed novels, but I think it’s interesting to see his writing develop. Two more tips: save an entire evening for the last 1/4 of each book, and pay really close attention to what a character says if you think their appearance is random. Stay away from the coppermind wiki cause you’ll get some really fun stuff spoiled. And when you start reading, DO NOT post about it or else you might get DMs trying to spoil you.\n",

After getting excited, he asked me if I was a writer and I told him I was only just beginning and unsure of myself and my writing skills. I’m heavily paraphrasing, but his advice to me was to start writing a little bit each day and slowly work on increasing my word count. As I made progress in my goal to write each day, I would get better and better at writing. The way I took it at the time was that I shouldn’t give up, no matter how bad I felt my writing was.\n",

I heard he was there signing autographs and so I went to go get in the line, but the workers wouldn’t let me come in because I hadn’t signed up. I ended up asking one of the attendants there how to sign up in the future and she walked me through it, but right as she was finishing explaining how to do it, somehow a gap formed in the line. I’m still not sure why this happened, but no one was coming up due to some admin problem going on. The attendant I was talking to grabbed me, told me it was my lucky day, and pushed me over to meet him. I was so startled at the suddenness of it, I’m sure I was a bit slack jawed at first.\n",

So we leave the auditorium everyone was in, and go to the one across the street, which is essentially an empty movie theater except for a few admins, and a bunch of leftover cake and goodie bags they were giving out as prizes to the interns.

Systems on the hard end of the spectrum can sometimes feel rather like  mechanistic superpowers to me without any of the magical/mystical feel softer systems can have.

And I guess it is easier to get the \"that was clever\" appeal with clear rules where you can make logical extrapolations.\n",

      "Comment by Writeloves: I also enjoy a good hard magic system, though I understand people who dislike it and think it’s takes the “magic” out of it. Ultimately it’s a spectrum, and can go in more flavors than just hard and soft. Sanderson is definitely “hard rules” magic as a resource with limitations like physics, LOTR is very “soft” spiritual powers and principalities type system. Harry Potter is more of a soft mess with a couple logic bones for story structure and a creative jumping point. \n",

      "Comment by None:  It's more about the execution than the actual magic system itself. My favorite system is the one used in the Malazan series which is somewhere between hard and soft magic with a heavy dose of philosophy as well. The rules aren't always explicit and no one really knows what a magical warren is but there are observable laws that explain a lot about the world. In many ways it functions a lot like science in that there is plenty undiscovered but what we have discovered operates on observable principals - \"power draws power\" functions similarly to gravity for instance which also explains why some of the extremely powerful entities in this world are wary of ever using hard power to have their way as it can very easily result in their death. Ultimately it comes down to how the magic system is used within the narrative though. I'm a huge fan of Sanderson and his magic systems are excellent but once we know how the magic system works explaining the specifics of how it is being used during a battle is unnecessary. Like I know this character can fly and how that works so I'd rather the focus be on the aerial fight itself and the life and death struggle than explanations of what lashings they're using to fly around.\n",

I think harry potters largest issue is that JK Rowling doesn't believe people can make things better, and that oozes through her books.

      "Anyways, The magic system moves toward soft magic with every book, but it's a symptom not a cause, I think. The second-largest issue is that she responds to criticism of a book two books later, i.e. book 3 time-turners destroyed in book 5. The movement towards soft magic is probably because of the continuous dissonance between a hard magic system and wholly irrational characters. Hard magic necessitates rational elements because hard magic inevitably results in characters needing to problem solve with their limited magic.\n",

Sure, some people may just want to pledge some support for an author they enjoy and are content with ebook/audiobook only, but something I think is maybe *especially* true about avid fantasy readers is that they like physical novels... especially neat, first print, hardbacks that look nice as a complete set on a bookshelf.

So in those scenarios he would maybe write a 150,000 word book in 15 days, which works out to 10,000 pages a day. But that of course is very different from a career average of 10,000 pages a day.\n",
